# Changing the Healthcare game by AI
# AI tools and technologies:
AI was the great invention for human being. Firstly, it become quite challenging about the picture and videos of human organs and muscles or the inner part of human body. Experts in this department have to go though some training to upgrade the AI technology and promised to use the AI tools in medical site. 

Researchers invented machine diagnosis by which they can take a look inside of body and can identify any object alone with take some image. The continuous monitoring can ensure early diagnosis for patients. Moreover, there are another technology call Computer vision for diagnosis. Which can have a deep look of tissues and can capture some videos. Also is Autonomous Robotic Surgeon which can utilize to do any surgery instead of doctors. Robotic system is mostly build with camera and mechanical arms with some surgical equipment. Those robotic surgeon can divided into group for different group and can be used as an assistant of a doctor during surgery.
# The new age of healthcare:
The machine learning system created a great impact on healthcare system in various way. By this way people can get whatever they want in their daily for their health. Now it become less time consuming to receive the result of any health care test alone with people can save their money by this fast process. Health care with AI technology means doctors and other healthcare specialized have to use computer and computer understandable code or language. Here, human cannot easily understand machine language. Thus, by through AI human can convert machine data into understandable language which is call Natural Language Process or NLP. This system can analyze the clinical notes on patients. Where doctors can store a vast amount of data simply and can find it simply which can cause a better result for patients. Moreover, this system use for improvement any clinical method alone with can upgrade the medicines. Data storage system can reduce the harassment of searching any document in a bundle of paper.
# AI medical industry in radiology:
Taking images of human body’s deep inside by through AI can be a fast process which is call radiology. Radiology use in human body to detect any injury and abnormality inside of body. AI can accurately identify any defect in a cell with a good accuracy. This thing is mostly helpful to identify cancer cell in body. Radiologic proved that AI can identify any human identification by image pattern. As example,

**1.1 MRI:** It can scan brain cell pattern. If a human face brain stroke then the cell pattern of that brain change instantly. 

**1.2 Autoimmune:** Here with AI technology take some images to understand present condition of immune system. It help to understand the process of disease. It can use to identify the level of toxicity in intestine.  

**1.3 Myocarditis:** Take the images of cardiac tissues which can only find only in heart. This image pattern identify the inflammation of cardiac tissue which extremely need any therapy or treatment. 
Framework with AI: By the word framework means making any process simpler and easier. To utilize AI in health care system have maintain some steps which are: have to utilize every process with having any restrictions and rules, the target group, upgrade of AI, timing of the process or any system, data security etc. In health care department there closed need to get connected with digital data science. There are some steps of frame works. Those are:

**1.1 Collection of data:** Taking the accurate data is necessary to have right output or result. For example getting image from deep inside of body to get the pattern. 

**1.2 Turning date into good shape**: Not every AI system can collect data serial wise. Thus, sometimes the experts have work on data to decorate those received data in an ideal shape.

**1.3 Creating a model:** It means after getting the data the health specialized have to understand the method. Or understand any treatment process of that specific disease. 

**1.4 Validity from clinic:** It can be happen that a model is wrong or have some small mistake. Thus, it need verification from a clinic to avoid any kind of mistake.

**1.5 Organizing the model in clinic:** In the health care to apply AI system the digital data and clinic stick together. Because anyone cannot enable AI in every step. Thus in some steps clinical customization of any model needed. 

**1.6 Share:** In this step the process of framework end. Where doctors provide the result of any test to their patients. This thing is totally compulsory.

# Gene editing with AI:
Experts are working out to improve artificial intelligence and about genetic engineering AI can two things. Which are identify any harmful gene and provide the treatment. Genetic engineering is a quite challenging thing. Moreover, there is an interesting thing which is upcoming. In future experts will be able to edit the genes of human body. During gene editing with CRISPR technology, the Cas9 scissors that cut DNA home on the right spot to snip with the help of guide RNA. This technology is utilize to create well developed DNA. Thus, the human body by their own way. Because of gene editing they can create an ideal human body structure. It means in future people can customize human body in their own way. Also, by the use of deep learning AI can identify glioma which is tumor. For this a 3D image pattern can identify this. 
# The future of AI in healthcare:
In this contemporary era, people are mostly based on technology and the demand of robots in every department increasing day by day. Specialized already invented tele medicine by which patients can get connected with doctors within a long distance by through online. Which is time consuming and can save money. Future of AI going to be more relaxing for the patients alone with nurse and doctors. Because of increasing the disease rate people are getting sick more and more. Thus, patients are not getting any appointment time from the doctors where in future patients will take the appointment easier and faster. Patients have to spend less time to fill-up the forms and payment process will be much easier. AI will be another blessing for hospitals. There will be less waiting period, reduce costs. Because of less errors in data system patients will get better treatment and will achieve patient’s satisfaction.
